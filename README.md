This is an internal internship project made to track and store data for an inventory management in the BINUS University building in Bandung.

This web app uses Laravel as it's framework and uses it's blade view page format for the frontend development.

There are two main users for this web app, namely the user and the admin. The admin's username and password will have to be set manually in the database, with the password using a hashing algorithm to keep it safe. The user on the other hand, doesn't need any password and can be created manually by the admin using the web app's interface.

The rest of the web app is related to the actual inventory management activities. There are things like adding new items to the inventory, editing, deleting, etc. There are also other features like stock opname to update the inventory, user can add/take item and change it's quantity, logs, and more.

The next development plan for the app is to add a barcode scanner compatibility to quickly take/input items for the users.
